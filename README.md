# Leo's Logout
This is an app to format a logout.

Finished project is being hosted [here](https://leos-logout.vercel.app)

Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## And that's it

I wish I had more to say, but that's about it.
